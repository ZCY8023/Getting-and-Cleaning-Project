* Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0

# The tidy data includes:
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
* Its descriptive activity name, which can be found in 'activity_labels.txt'. 
* variables : features on the mean or standard deviation. The variable names are modified by dropping '()', for example "tBodyAcc-mean-Y" instead of "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y". See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 


# Operations performed:
* Merges the training and test sets
* Extracts the measurements on the mean and std
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Labels the data set with descriptive variable names
* Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
