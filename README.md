# Submission of the Project:

* A tidy data set called TidyData.txt
* A link to a Github repo with the script called run_analysis.R
* A codebook that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
* A README.md


# Goal of the file run_analysis.R :

* Merges the training and test sets
* Extracts the measurements on the mean and std
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Labels the data set with descriptive variable names
* Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
